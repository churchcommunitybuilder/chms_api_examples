# Church Community Builder CHMS Api Examples
In this repo are a handful of examples on how to authenticate and make calls
against our chms api. Our api is a restful, json api with OAuth authentication.
Most of the examples show at least the system auth flow and making at least one
authenticated api call. Detailed setup instructions are in the README.md in
each sub directory.
