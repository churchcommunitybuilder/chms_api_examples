# Church Community Builder CHMS Api Examples
In this repo is a handful of examples on how to authenticate and make calls
against our chms api. Most of the examples show at least the system auth flow
and making at least one authenticated api call. Detailed setup instructions are
in the README.md in each sub directory.
